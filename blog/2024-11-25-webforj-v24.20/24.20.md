## New features and enhancements 🎉

We’re excited to introduce version `24.20` which brings a game-changing update to webforJ - the shift to **WAR deployment**.

### WAR Deployment in webforJ
<!-- vale on -->

In `24.20`, webforJ fully embraces the WAR (Web Application Archive) pattern for packaging and deploying apps. WAR files are a tried-and-true standard in Java development, bundling everything your app needs - code, resources, and dependencies - into a single, deployable archive.


### Updating your project for WAR deployment

Switching your project to use WAR deployment in webforJ is straightforward. To do so, ensure the following components are in place:

1. **Include the Maven Jetty Plugin**:

Add the Maven Jetty plugin to your pom.xml to handle the deployment process. The Jetty plugin allows you to package and deploy your app as a WAR file effortlessly.

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
    <artifactId>jetty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>11.0.15</version>
</plugin>
```

:::info Replacing the webforJ install plugin
In projects using the webforJ install plugin, remove this plugin from your POM to ensure that it isn't triggered when running `mvn install`.
:::

2. **Add the required configuration and resources:**

Include the following essential files in your project to ensure it runs as a WAR:

- `webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml`:
Defines the app's deployment descriptor, specifying how the app should be deployed and managed by the server.

- `resources/webforj.conf`:
Centralized configuration file for customizing your app's behavior.

- `resources/certificate.bls`:
A license certificate file required to run your app. You’ll receive this file when registering for a license.

- `resources/blsclient.conf`:
Configuration file for license properties.

Once added, an example project structure may look like this:

```bash 
src/main/
    java/                      # Java source files
    resources/
        webforj.conf           # App configuration
        blsclient.conf         # License configuration
        certificate.bls        # License certificate
    webapp/
        WEB-INF/
            web.xml            # Deployment descriptor
```
### Configuration with `webforj.conf`

The `webforj.conf` file centralizes app configuration in HOCON format. With this file, you can tweak key settings for your app, such as the app's entry point, and whether or not to run in `DEBUG` mode.

Here are some of the most useful settings you can define in `webforj.conf`:
| **Property**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                     | **Default**       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `webforj.entry`             | The fully qualified name of the class that extends `App`, acting as the entry point for your app.                                                 | *Not Set*         |
| `webforj.debug`             | Enables debug mode, showing detailed errors in the browser and printing debug logs to the console.                                                | `false`           |
| `webforj.reloadOnServerError` | Automatically reloads the app if the server temporarily becomes unavailable during development.                                                  | `on`              |
| `webforj.clientHeartbeatRate` | Sets the interval for client pings to the server to query availability. Use shorter intervals in development and longer ones in production.         | `50s`             |

### Configuring the `web.xml` file

The `web.xml` file is a crucial part of Java web app deployment, serving as the deployment descriptor for your app. In webforJ, it defines key settings like the servlet configuration and URL mappings. This file must be located in the `WEB-INF` directory of your project’s deployment structure.

| **Setting**                     | **Explanation**                                                                                                            | **Default Value**        |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `<display-name>`                | Sets the display name for the web app, typically derived from the project name. This name appears in app servers' management consoles. | `${project.name}`        |
| `<servlet>` and `<servlet-mapping>` | Defines the `WebforjServlet`, the core servlet for handling webforJ requests. This servlet is mapped to all URLs (`/*`), making it the main entry point for web requests. | `WebforjServlet`         |
| `<load-on-startup>`             | Specifies that `WebforjServlet` should be loaded when the app starts. Setting this to `1` ensures the servlet loads immediately, improving initial request handling. | `1`                      |

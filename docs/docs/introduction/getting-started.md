This article outlines the steps to scaffold a new webforJ app using the webforJ archetypes. This archetypes provide a pre-configured project structure and starter code to quickly get a project up and running.

:::tip Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have reviewed the necessary [prerequisites](./prerequisites) for setting up and using webforJ. This will ensure that you have all the required tools and configurations in place before starting your project.

## Using the `hello-world` archetype

To create and scaffold a new `hello-world` project, follow these steps:

1) **Navigate to the proper directory**:
Open a terminal and move to the folder where you want to create your new project.

2) **Run the `archetype:generate` command**:
Use the Maven command below, and customize the `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version` as needed for your project.

| Argument             | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `archetypeGroupId` | The group ID of the archetype is `com.webforj` for webforJ archetypes.|
| `archetypeArtifactId` | Specifies the name of the archetype to use. |
| `archetypeVersion` | Specifies the version of the archetype to use. This ensures that the generated project is compatible with a specific archetype version. Using LATEST selects the most recent version available.|
| `groupId`          | Represents the namespace for the generated project. Typically structured like a Java package, such as `org.example` and is used to uniquely identify your organization or project domain.|
| `artifactId`       | Specifies the name of the generated project. This will be the name of the resulting artifact and the project folder.|
| `version`          | Defines the version of the generated project. A common convention is MAJOR.MINOR-SNAPSHOT, like `1.0-SNAPSHOT`, where SNAPSHOT denotes that the project is still in development.|


After running the command, Maven will generate the project files necessary to run the project.


:::tip
webforJ comes with several predefined archetypes that help you quickly start your webforJ development. To see a complete list of available archetypes, please refer to the [archetypes catalog](../building-ui/archetypes/overview).

### Run the app

Navigate into the newly created directory, and run the following command from the projectâ€™s root directory:

```bash
mvn jetty:run
```

This command uses the Jetty maven plugin to start a Jetty server. Once the server is running, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the app.

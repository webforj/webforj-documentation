This article outlines the steps to scaffold a new webforJ app using the webforJ archetypes. This archetypes provide a pre-configured project structure and starter code to quickly get a project up and running.

:::tip Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have reviewed the necessary [prerequisites](./prerequisites) for setting up and using webforJ. This will ensure that you have all the required tools and configurations in place before starting your project.

## Using startforJ

The simplest way to set up a new webforJ app is by utilizing [startforJ](https://docs.webforj.com/startforj). It generates a minimal starter project based on various available archetypes that includes all required dependencies, configuration files, and a pre-wired layout - ready to build on.

  </video>
</div>

Using startforJ:

- Generates a project with all necessary configuration  
- Prompts you for basic project metadata (e.g., `groupId`, `artifactId`, project name)  
- Allows you to choose your desired webforJ and Java version
- Lets you select a **theme color**, **icon**, and **archetype**  
- Produces a downloadable ZIP, or publishes the project directly to GitHub  

Visit: [https://docs.webforj.com/startforj](https://docs.webforj.com/startforj)

Once downloaded, unzip the project and open the folder in your IDE.

:::tip Available Archetypes
webforJ comes with several predefined archetypes that help you quickly start your webforJ development. To see a complete list of available archetypes, please refer to the [archetypes catalog](../building-ui/archetypes/overview).

## Using the command line

For those who prefer using the command line, you can also generate a project directly using the Maven archetype:

<ComponentArchetype
project="hello-world"
/>

## Run the app

Navigate into the newly created directory, and run the following command from the projectâ€™s root directory:

```bash
mvn jetty:run
```

This command uses the Jetty maven plugin to start a Jetty server. Once the server is running, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the app.

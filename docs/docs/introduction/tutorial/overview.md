This step-by-step tutorial guides you through the process of building a customer management app using webforJ and Spring Boot. It teaches you how to create a modern, user-friendly interface for viewing, adding, and editing customer data.

Each step results in a runnable Spring Boot app (JAR) that introduces new concepts. You can launch your app locally using Maven and interact with it in a web browser. With this setup, you get a fast development cycle and a production-ready deployment model, using Spring Boot’s embedded server.

While you should have a basic understanding of Java and Maven to get the most out of this tutorial, no prior Spring Boot or webforJ experience is needed. This tutorial will cover Spring concepts as they come up, but for those interested in an in-depth understanding of Spring can go to [Spring's main documentation](https://spring.io/learn) and Spring's documentation about [Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/index.html).

## Tutorial concepts {#tutorial-concepts}

The first part of the tutorial is dedicated to [Project setup](/docs/introduction/tutorial/project-setup) to prepare your Spring Boot + webforJ environment. Then, there are **four steps** to introduce new features and advance your project. By following along, you’ll gain a clear understanding of how an app evolves as you implement features.

Each step has a corresponding runnable app that’s available on GitHub to look at as you progress through the tutorial:

This tutorial guides you step by step through building a customer management app using webforJ with Spring Boot. The app demonstrates how to use webforJ to create a modern, user-friendly interface for viewing, adding, and editing customer data. Each section builds on the previous, but you can skip ahead as needed.

Each step in the tutorial results in a runnable Spring Boot app (JAR), which you can launch locally using Maven. With this setup, you get a fast development cycle and a production-ready deployment model, using Spring Boot’s embedded server.

title: Overview
---

This tutorial is designed to guide you step by step through the process of creating the app. This app, designed to manage customer information, demonstrates how to use webforJ to build a functional and user-friendly interface with features for viewing, adding, and editing customer data. Each section will build upon the last, but feel free to skip ahead as needed.

Each step in the tutorial will result in a program that compiles into a WAR file, which can be deployed to any Java web app server. For this tutorial, the Maven Jetty plugin will be used to deploy the app locally. This lightweight setup ensures the app can quickly run, and that changes will be seen in real time during development.

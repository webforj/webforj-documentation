Applications rely on various types of resources, such as JavaScript, CSS, and images. This document provides a comprehensive technical exploration of webforJâ€™s resource-handling mechanisms, covering declarative annotations, programmatic API methods, and custom protocol utilization.  

webforJ adopts a modular approach to resource management, offering multiple mechanisms to address different app needs:  

- **Declarative Annotations**: Embed JavaScript and CSS resources at the components or app level.  
- **API-Based Dynamic Injection**: Inject resources at runtime to enable dynamic app behavior.  
- **Custom Protocols**: Provide standardized methodologies for resource access.  
- **File Streaming and Controlled Downloads**: Facilitate managed retrieval and transmission of resource files.

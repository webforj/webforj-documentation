# Tabs archetype

The `tabs` starting project generates an app with a simple tabbed interface. Ideal for projects that require multiple views or sections accessible via tabs, this archetype provides a clean and organized way to manage different parts of your app, making it easy to navigate between various sections without cluttering the user interface.

## Using the `tabs` archetype

<ComponentArchetype
project="tabs"
/>

### Run the app

Navigate into the newly created directory, and run the following command from the projectâ€™s root directory:

```bash
mvn jetty:run
```

This command uses the Jetty maven plugin to start a Jetty server. Once the server is running, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the app.

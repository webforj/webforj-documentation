# Tabs archetype

The `tabs` starting project generates an app with a simple tabbed interface. Ideal for projects that require multiple views or sections accessible via tabs, this archetype provides a clean and organized way to manage different parts of your app, making it easy to navigate between various sections without cluttering the user interface.

# SideMenu archetype
<!-- vale on -->

For projects that need a structured navigation system, the `sidemenu` archetype is a great starting place. This archetype contains a side menu and a content area, and is designed to help you create apps with a clear and intuitive navigation structure, making it easier for users to find and access different parts of your app.

## Using the `sidemenu` archetype

<ComponentArchetype
project="sidemenu"
/>

### Run the app

Navigate into the newly created directory, and run the following command from the projectâ€™s root directory:

```bash
mvn jetty:run
```

This command uses the Jetty maven plugin to start a Jetty server. Once the server is running, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the app.

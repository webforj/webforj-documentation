# Blank archetype

The `blank` archetype is a foundational starter project for webforJ applications. This template provides a clean slate for you to build your app from scratch. It's ideal for developers who want complete control over the structure and components of their app without any predefined constraints.

## Using the `blank` archetype

<ComponentArchetype
project="blank"
/>

### Run the app

Navigate into the newly created directory, and run the following command from the projectâ€™s root directory:

```bash
mvn jetty:run
```

This command uses the Jetty maven plugin to start a Jetty server. Once the server is running, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the app.

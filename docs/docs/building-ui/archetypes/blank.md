# Blank archetype

The `blank` archetype is a foundational starter project for webforJ applications. This template provides a clean slate for you to build your app from scratch. It's ideal for developers who want complete control over the structure and components of their app without any predefined constraints.

:::tip Using startforJ
For more control over customization and configuration, you can use [startforJ](https://docs.webforj.com/startforj/) to create your project - just select the `Blank` archetype when choosing configuration options.

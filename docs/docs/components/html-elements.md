title: HTML Element Components

webforJ ships a set of components that map directly to standard HTML elements, giving you a typed Java API for the most common building blocks of web pages. For a comprehensive reference on each underlying HTML element, see the [MDN HTML element reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

## Working with children

Components marked with ✔️ in the **Children** column support adding, removing, and accessing child components. These methods are provided through the [`Element`](../building-ui/element#component-interaction) class.

For creating arbitrary HTML elements beyond those listed here, or for embedding custom web components, see the [`Element`](../building-ui/element) documentation.

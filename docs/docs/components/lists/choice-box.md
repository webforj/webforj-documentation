The `ChoiceBox` component is a user interface element designed to present users with a list of options or choices. Users can select a single option from this list, typically by clicking the `ChoiceBox`, which triggers the display of a dropdown list containing available choices. Users can also interact with the `ChoiceBox` with the arrow keys. When a user makes a selection, the chosen option is then displayed in the `ChoiceBox` button.

## Usages
`ChoiceBox` components are used for various purposes, such as selecting items from a menu, choosing from a list of categories, or picking options from predefined sets. They provide an organized and visually pleasing way for users to make selections, particularly when there are multiple options available. Common usages include:

1. **User Selection of Options**: The primary purpose of a `ChoiceBox` is to allow users to select a single option from a list. This is valuable in applications that require users to make choices, such as:
    - Choosing from a list of categories
    - Picking options from predefined sets

2. **Form Inputs**: When designing forms that require users to input specific options, the `ChoiceBox` simplifies the selection process. Whether it's selecting a country, state, or any other option from a predefined list, the `ChoiceBox` streamlines the input process.

3. **Filtering and Sorting**: `ChoiceBox` can be employed for filtering and sorting tasks in applications. Users can choose filter criteria or sorting preferences from a list, facilitating the organization and navigation of data.

4. **Configuration and Settings**: When your application includes settings or configuration options, the `ChoiceBox` provides an intuitive way for users to adjust preferences. Users can pick settings from a list, making it easy to tailor the application to their needs.

:::tip
The `ChoiceBox` is intended for use when a preset number of options are available, and custom options should not be allowed or included. If allowing users to enter custom values is desired, use a [`ComboBox`](./combo-box.md) instead

## Dropdown type

Using the <JavadocLink type="foundation" location="com/webforj/component/list/DwcSelectDropdown" code='true' suffix='#setDropdownType(java.lang.String)'>setDropdownType()</JavadocLink> method will assign a value to the `type` attribute of a `ChoiceBox`, and a corresponding value for the `data-dropdown-for` attribute in the dropdown of the `ChoiceBox`. This is helpful for styling, as the dropdown is taken out of its current position in the DOM and relocated to the end of the page body when opened.

<!-- ![example type](../_images/choicebox/type.png)
![example type](../_images/choicebox/type_zoomed.png) -->

This detachment creates a situation where directly targeting the
dropdown using CSS or shadow part selectors from the parent component becomes challenging, unless you make use of the dropdown type attribute.

In the demo below, the Dropdown type is set and used in the CSS file to select the dropdown and change the background color.

/>

## Max row count

By default, the number of rows displayed in the dropdown of a `ChoiceBox` will be increased to fit the content. However, using the <JavadocLink type="foundation" location="com/webforj/component/list/DwcSelectDropdown" code='true' suffix='#setMaxRowCount(int)'>setMaxRowCount()</JavadocLink> method allows for control over how many items are displayed. 

:::tip
Using a number that is less than or equal to 0 will result in unsetting this property.

## Opening and closing

The visibility of the options for a `ChoiceBox` can be programmatically controlled with the `open()` and `close()` methods.
These methods allow you to display the list of options for selection or hide it as needed, providing greater flexibility in managing the behavior of a `ChoiceBox`.

Additionally, webforJ has event listeners for when the `ChoiceBox` is closed and when it's opened, giving you more control to trigger specific actions.

```Java
//Focus or open the next component in a form
ChoiceBox university = new ChoiceBox("University");
ChoiceBox major = new ChoiceBox("Major");
Button submit = new Button("Submit");

//... Add lists of universities and majors

university.onClose( e ->{
  major.focus();
});

major.onClose( e ->{
  submit.focus();
});
```

## Opening dimensions

The `ChoiceBox` component has methods that allow manipulation of the dropdown dimensions. The **maximum height** and **minimum width** of the dropdown can be set using the <JavadocLink type="foundation" location="com/webforj/component/list/DwcSelectDropdown" code='true' suffix='#setOpenHeight(int)'>setOpenHeight()</JavadocLink> and <JavadocLink type="foundation" location="com/webforj/component/list/DwcSelectDropdown" code='true' suffix='#setOpenWidth(int)'>setOpenWidth()</JavadocLink> methods, respectively. 

:::tip
Passing a `String` value to either of these methods will allow for [any valid CSS unit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units) to be applied, such as pixels, viewport dimensions, or other valid rules. Passing an `int` will set the value passed in pixels.

## Prefix and suffix

Slots provide flexible options for improving the capability of a `ChoiceBox`. You can have icons, labels, loading spinners, clear/reset capability, avatar/profile pictures, and other beneficial components nested within a `ChoiceBox` to further clarify intended meaning to users.
The `ChoiceBox` has two slots: the `prefix` and `suffix` slots. Use the `setPrefixComponent()` and `setSuffixComponent()` methods to insert various components before and after the displayed option within a `ChoiceBox`.

```java
ComboBox choiceBox = new ChoiceBox());
  choiceBox.setPrefixComponent(TablerIcon.create("box"));
  choiceBox.setSuffixComponent(TablerIcon.create("box"));
```

## Styling

### Shadow parts

These are the various parts of the [shadow DOM](../../glossary#shadow-dom) for the `ChoiceBox` component, which will be required when styling via CSS is desired.

<TableBuilder tag={require('@site/docs/components/_dwc_control_map.json').ChoiceBox} table='parts' exclusions='' />

### CSS properties

These are the various CSS properties that are used in the component, with a short description of their use.

<TableBuilder tag={require('@site/docs/components/_dwc_control_map.json').ChoiceBox} exclusions='' table='properties'/>

### Reflected attributes

The reflected attributes of a component will be shown as attributes in the rendered HTML element for the component in the DOM. This means that styling can be applied using these attributes.

<TableBuilder tag={require('@site/docs/components/_dwc_control_map.json').ChoiceBox} table="reflects" exclusions=''/>

### Dependencies

This component relies on the following components - see the related article for more detailed styling information:

<TableBuilder tag='dwc-choicebox' table="dependencies"/>

## Best practices 

To ensure an optimal user experience when using the `ChoiceBox` component, consider the following best practices:

1. **Clear and Limited Options**: Keep the list of choices concise where possible, and relevant to the user's task. A `ChoiceBox` is ideal for presenting a clear list of options.

2. **User-Friendly Labels**: Ensure that the displayed labels for each option are user-friendly and self-explanatory. Make sure users can easily understand the purpose of each choice.

3. **Default Selection**: Set a default selection when the ChoiceBox is initially displayed. This ensures a pre-selected option, reducing the number of interactions required to make a choice.

4. **ChoiceBox vs. Other List Components**: A `ChoiceBox` is the best choice if you need to restrict user input to a single choice from a list of predetermined options. Another list component may be better if you need the following behaviors:
    - Multiple Selection and display all items at once: [`ListBox`](./list-box.md)
    - Allow custom input: [`ComboBox`](./combo-box.md)

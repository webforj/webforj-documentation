The `Table` component allows you to implement filtering functionality to narrow down displayed data based on specific criteria. Filtering can be achieved by defining a filtering criteria using the `setFilter(Predicate<T> filter)` method provided by the `Repository` associated with the table.

In the above example, the `setFilter()` method is used to define a filtering criteria based on the title of `MusicRecord`. 

:::tip
The `setFilter()` method belongs to the `Repository` class, and is not a built-in behavior of the `Table` itself.

The filter is then applied when the user modifies the content of the search field, updating the searchTerm and triggering the `commit()` method to refresh the displayed data.

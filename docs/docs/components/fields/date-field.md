The `DateField` is a field component that allows users to input or select dates by the year, month, and day. It provides an intuitive and efficient way to handle date-related information in various apps, and offers the flexibility to validate a user's input.

## Usages

The `DateField` is ideal for choosing and displaying dates in your app. Here are some examples of when to use the `DateField`:

1. **Event Scheduling and Calendars**: Date fields are essential in apps that involve scheduling events, booking appointments, or keeping track of important dates.

2. **Form Inputs**: Simplify the date selection process for a user filling out a form that requires a date, like a birthday.

3. **Booking and Reservation Systems**: Apps that involve booking and reservation systems often require users to input specific dates. A date field streamlines the process and ensures accurate date selection.

4. **Task Management and Deadlines**: Date fields are valuable in apps that involve task management or setting deadlines. Users can easily specify due dates, start dates, or other time-sensitive information.

## Maximum and minimum

With the `setMax()` and `setMin()` methods, you can specify a range of acceptable dates. If a user manually enters a value into the date field outside the specified range, the component will let the user know what's acceptable. Also, if a maximum or minimum is already set, the value for the other method must be lower or higher respectively.

## Localized display

By default, the `DateField` displays information within the UI element based on the locale the browser is configured to. For example, users with United States configurations will see MM/dd/yyyy, whereas European users will see dd/MM/yyyy. Still, this doesn't stop you from manipulating the `LocalDate` object returned by the methods from the `DataField` class.

## Static utilities

The `DateField` class also provides the following static utility methods:

- `fromDate(String dateAsString)`: Convert a date string in yyyy-MM-dd format to a `LocalDate` object which can then be utilized with this field, or elsewhere.

- `toDate(LocalDate date)`: Convert a `LocalDate` object to a date string in yyyy-MM-dd format.

- `isValidDate(String dateAsString)`: Checks to see if the given string is a valid yyyy-MM-dd date.

## Best practices

To ensure an optimal user experience when using the `DateField` component, consider the following best practices:

- **Accessibility**: Utilize appropriate labels to ensure users with assistive technologies can easily navigate to and use the date fields in your app.

- **Auto-Populate Current Date**: If appropriate for your app's use case, auto-populate with the date field with the current date.

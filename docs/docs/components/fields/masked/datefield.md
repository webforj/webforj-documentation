The `MaskedDateField` is a text input control designed for structured date entry. It lets users enter dates as **numbers** and automatically formats the input based on a defined mask when the field loses focus. The mask is a string that specifies the expected date format, guiding both input and display.

This component supports flexible parsing, validation, localization, and value restoration. It's especially useful in forms like registrations, bookings, and scheduling, where consistent and region-specific date formats are required.

:::tip Looking for time input?
The `MaskedDateField` is focused solely on **date** values. If you need a similar component for entering and formatting **time**, look into the [`MaskedTimeField`](./timefield) instead.
:::

## Basics

The `MaskedDateField` can be instantiated with or without parameters. You can define an initial value, a label, a placeholder, and an event listener for value changes.

<ComponentDemo path='/webforj/maskeddatefield?' javaE='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webforj/webforj-documentation/refs/heads/main/src/main/java/com/webforj/samples/views/fields/maskeddatefield/MaskedDateFieldView.java' height='120px'/>

## Mask rules

The `MaskedDateField` supports multiple date formats used around the world, which vary by the order of day, month, and year. Common patterns include:

- **Day/Month/Year** (used across most of Europe)
- **Month/Day/Year** (used in the United States)
- **Year/Month/Day** (used in China, Japan, and Korea; also the ISO standard: `YYYY-MM-DD`)

Within these formats, local variations include the choice of separator (e.g., `-`, `/`, or `.`), whether years are two or four digits, and whether single-digit months or days are padded with leading zeros.

To handle this diversity, the `MaskedDateField` uses format indicators, each starting with `%`, followed by a letter that represents a specific part of the date. These indicators define how input is parsed and how the date is displayed.

### Date format indicators

| Format | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `%Y`   | Year        |
| `%M`   | Month       |
| `%D`   | Day         |

### Modifiers

Modifiers allow more control over how components of the date are formatted:

| Modifier | Description               |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| `z`      | Zero-fill                 |
| `s`      | Short text representation |
| `l`      | Long text representation  |
| `p`      | Packed number             |
| `d`      | Decimal (default format)  |

These can be combined to build a wide variety of date masks.

## Date format localization

The `MaskedDateField` adapts to regional date formats by setting the appropriate locale. This ensures that dates are displayed and parsed in a way that matches user expectations.

| Region        | Format     | Example      |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| United States | MM/DD/YYYY | `07/04/2023` |
| Europe        | DD/MM/YYYY | `04/07/2023` |
| ISO Standard  | YYYY-MM-DD | `2023-07-04` |

To apply localization, use the `setLocale()` method. It accepts a [`java.util.Locale`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Locale.html) and automatically adjusts both formatting and parsing:

```java
dateField.setLocale(Locale.FRANCE);
```

## Parsing logic

The `MaskedDateField` parses user input based on the defined date mask. It accepts both complete and abbreviated numeric inputs with or without delimiters, allowing flexible entry while ensuring valid dates.
Parsing behavior depends on the format order defined by the mask (e.g., `%Mz/%Dz/%Yz` for month/day/year). This format determines how numeric sequences are interpreted.

For example, assuming that today is `September 15, 2012`, this is how various inputs would be interpreted:

## Setting min/max constraints

You can restrict the allowed date range in a `MaskedDateField` using the `setMin()` and `setMax()` methods:

```java
dateField.setMin(LocalDate.of(2020, 1, 1));
dateField.setMax(LocalDate.of(2030, 12, 31));
```

Both methods accept values of type [`java.time.LocalDate`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/LocalDate.html). Input outside the defined range will be considered invalid.

## Restoring the value

The `MaskedDateField` includes a restore feature that resets the fieldâ€™s value to a predefined or original state. This is useful for reverting user input or resetting to a default date.

```java
dateField.setRestoreValue(LocalDate.of(2025, 1, 1));
dateField.restoreValue();
```

### Ways to restore the value

- **Programmatically**, by calling `restoreValue()`
- **Via keyboard**, by pressing <kbd>ESC</kbd> (this is the default restore key unless overridden by an event listener)

You can set the value to restore with `setRestoreValue()`, passing a [`LocalDate`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/LocalDate.html) instance.

height='120px'/>

## Validation patterns

You can apply client-side validation rules using regular expressions with the `setPattern()` method:

```java
dateField.setPattern("^\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}$");
```

This pattern ensures that only values matching the `MM/DD/YYYY` format (two digits, slash, two digits, slash, four digits) are considered valid.

:::tip Regular Expression Format
The pattern must follow JavaScript RegExp syntax as documented [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions).
:::

:::warning Notes on Input Handling
The field attempts to parse and format numeric date inputs based on the current mask. However, users can still manually enter values that don't match the expected format. If the input is syntactically valid but semantically incorrect or unparsable (e.g. `99/99/9999`), it may pass pattern checks but fail logical validation.
You should always validate the input value in your app logic, even if a regular expression pattern is set, to ensure the date is both correctly formatted and meaningful.

## Date picker

The `MaskedDateField` includes a built-in calendar picker that lets users select a date visually, rather than typing it. This enhances usability for less technical users or when precise input is required.

<ComponentDemo 
path='/webforj/maskeddatefieldpicker?' 
javaE='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webforj/webforj-documentation/refs/heads/main/src/main/java/com/webforj/samples/views/fields/maskeddatefield/MaskedDateFieldPickerView.java' 
height='450px'/>

### Accessing the picker

You can access the date picker using `getPicker()`:

```java
DatePicker picker = dateField.getPicker();
```

### Show/hide the picker icon

Use `setIconVisible()` to show or hide the calendar icon next to the field:

```java
picker.setIconVisible(true); // shows the icon
```

### Auto-open behavior

You can configure the picker to open automatically when the user interacts with the field (e.g., clicks, presses Enter or arrow keys):

```java
picker.setAutoOpen(true);
```

:::tip Enforce Selection Through the Picker
To ensure users can only select a date using the calendar picker (and not manually type one), combine the following two settings:

```java
dateField.getPicker().setAutoOpen(true); // Opens the picker on user interaction
dateField.setAllowCustomValue(false);    // Disables manual text input
```

This setup guarantees that all date input comes through the picker UI, which is useful when you want strict format control and eliminate parsing issues from typed input.
:::

### Manually open the calendar

To open the calendar programmatically:

```java
picker.open();
```

Or use the alias:

```java
picker.show(); // same as open()
```

### Show weeks in the calendar

The picker can optionally display week numbers in the calendar view:

```java
picker.setShowWeeks(true);
```

## `MaskedDateFieldSpinner`

The `MaskedDateFieldSpinner` extends [`MaskedDateField`](#basics) by adding spinner controls that let users increment or decrement the date using arrow keys or UI buttons. It provides a more guided interaction style, especially useful in desktop-style applications.

<ComponentDemo 
path='/webforj/maskeddatefieldspinner?' 
javaE='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webforj/webforj-documentation/refs/heads/main/src/main/java/com/webforj/samples/views/fields/maskeddatefield/MaskedDateFieldSpinnerView.java' 
height='450px'/>

### Key features

- **Interactive Date Stepping:**  
  Use arrow keys or spin buttons to increment or decrement the date value.

- **Customizable Step Unit:**  
  Choose which part of the date to modify using `setSpinField()`:

  ```java
  spinner.setSpinField(MaskedDateFieldSpinner.SpinField.MONTH);
  ```

  Options include `DAY`, `WEEK`, `MONTH`, and `YEAR`.

- **Min/Max Boundaries:**  
  Inherits support for minimum and maximum allowed dates using `setMin()` and `setMax()`.

- **Formatted Output:**  
  Fully compatible with masks and localization settings from `MaskedDateField`.

### Example: Configure weekly stepping

```java
MaskedDateFieldSpinner spinner = new MaskedDateFieldSpinner();
spinner.setSpinField(MaskedDateFieldSpinner.SpinField.WEEK);
```

This makes each spin step advance or rewind the date by one week.

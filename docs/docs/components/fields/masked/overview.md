Masked fields are input components designed to guide users toward entering data in a specific, predefined format. They are especially useful in forms that require structured input—like dates, times, numbers, or custom identifiers—where consistency and correctness are critical.

By enforcing formatting rules at the input level, masked fields reduce errors, improve data quality, and enhance usability by clearly showing what type of input is expected. They’re commonly used in financial apps, booking systems, administrative dashboards, and any interface that handles precise or regulated input.

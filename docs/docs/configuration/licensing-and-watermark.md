title: Licensing and Watermark
---

By default, webforJ projects can be run but won't have a license certificate associated with them. When running an unlicensed project, a watermark will display on the running app's UI until a valid license has been entered.

<!-- TODO add link -->

For individual developers, getting a trial license certificate of webforJ is simple, visit the license certification request form, fill out the details, and submit the form. Once submitted, and confirmation email with an attached `certificate.bls` file will be sent to the provided email.

Place this file inside of the `resources` directory of a project, and the watermark will no longer display.

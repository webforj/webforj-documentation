<!-- This article is solely for testing what vale catches -->

## Capitalization

Will this sentence WebforJ and Startforj should also be capitalized as webforJ and startforJ, even at the beginning of a sentence.

## EM dashes

Em dashes—a unique way to create emphasis in writing—should be used only once per article.
Vale catches the first occurrence of an em dash if multiple are inside an article.

## Linking verb

Avoid versions of the following phrases and instead focus more on explicitly defining what a feature does:

- improve the performance
- enhance user experience and feel
- ensure consistency
- optimize benefits

## Simplify

Utilize a more simple way of writing content, leveraging off a more natural-sounding tone.

## Fluff

The webforJ framework is robust and seamlessly incorporate designs, but be deliberate with how features are documented.

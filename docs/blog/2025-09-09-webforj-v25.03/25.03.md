webforJ version `25.03` introduces new capabilities for configuration management, Spring integration options, routing improvements, and `Table` component updates.

<!-- truncate -->

As always, see the [GitHub release overview](https://github.com/webforj/webforj/releases/tag/25.03) for a more comprehensive list of changes. Highlighted below are some of the most exciting changes:

## New features and enhancements ðŸŽ‰

### Early lifecycle hooks for configuration management

webforJ `25.03` introduces `onWillCreate` and `onDidCreate` lifecycle hooks that give control over app initialization. These new hooks fire at critical moments during startup â€“ `onWillCreate` executes before your app instance is created, while `onDidCreate` runs immediately after creation but before serving requests.

These additions solve a common challenge in enterprise applications: performing operations like validating environment variables, configuring logging systems, or establishing database connections at exactly the right moment during startup. With these hooks, you can now modify configuration before it locks, validate prerequisites, and set up resources your app depends on.

### Spring properties file configuration support

Configuration with Spring Boot has seen improvements in `25.03`. Configure your webforJ applications directly in `application.properties` or `application.yml` files using the `webforj.*` prefix â€“ from servlet mappings and debug settings to file upload limits and custom servlet registration.

The system respects Spring Boot's configuration hierarchy, so properties from environment variables, command-line arguments, and external configuration sources all work as expected.

:::tip Migration path
Moving from `webforj.conf` to Spring properties? Both approaches work side-by-side during migration. Spring properties take precedence when both are present, allowing for gradual transition.

### Spring MVC coexistence at root path

webforJ `25.03` enables seamless integration with Spring MVC when deployed at the root path ("/"). This solves a challenge where webforJ's servlet registration at root would conflict with Spring's DispatcherServlet, preventing the use of REST endpoints and Spring MVC controllers alongside webforJ routes.

The new integration approach registers the webforJ servlet at an internal path and forwards requests through Spring MVC's handler chain. This maintains full compatibility with Spring features like filters, interceptors, and other handler mappings while preserving webforJ's routing capabilities. Now you can build hybrid applications that leverage both Spring MVC REST endpoints for APIs and webforJ routes for rich UI components.

When webforJ is mapped to the root context, you can exclude specific URL patterns from webforJ handling using the `webforj.exclude-urls` property. This allows Spring MVC controllers to handle paths like `/api/**` for REST endpoints or `/actuator/**` for Spring Boot actuator endpoints, while webforJ handles all other routes.

### Spring custom scopes for webforJ environments and routes

Version `25.03` introduces three powerful Spring scope annotations designed specifically for component-based architectures: `@WebforjSessionScope`, `@EnvironmentScope` and `@RouteScope`. These new scopes align bean lifecycles with webforJ's runtime model, ensuring beans exist exactly as long as they're needed.

`@WebforjSessionScope` creates beans that persist across the entire webforJ session, shared across all browser tabs and windows from the same browser. Unlike environment-scoped beans which isolate state per tab, session-scoped beans maintain shared state for authentication, user preferences, and shopping carts. When a user logs in through one tab, all other tabs immediately have access to the authenticated state.

`@EnvironmentScope` ties beans to individual browser windows or tabs â€“ each tab gets its own isolated instance, ideal for tab-specific state that shouldn't be shared across windows. Beans remain available throughout the entire tab session, perfect for maintaining UI state, user preferences, or cached data specific to that browser context.

`@RouteScope` binds beans to route hierarchies, where parent and child routes share instances but navigating to different route trees creates fresh beans. This scope is particularly useful for managing state within multi-step workflows or nested route structures, ensuring data consistency within a route context while providing clean separation between different application areas. For finer control, the `@SharedFrom` annotation lets you customize scope boundaries, restricting bean availability to specific component subtrees and enforcing architectural boundaries with runtime validation.

### Table column sizing and moving support

The `Table` has been enhanced in this release to introduce comprehensive column manipulation capabilities. Users can now drag column borders to resize, and drag headers to reorder their respective columns. 

The new column management APIs offer both interactive and programmatic control. Set width constraints with `setMinWidth()` and `setMaxWidth()`, enable resizing with `setResizable(true)`, allow reordering with `setMovable(true)`, and implement flex sizing with `setFlex()` for responsive layouts. Event listeners for resize and move operations enable preference persistence and custom state management.

These features are particularly valuable in data-heavy applications like financial dashboards and reporting tools, where different users need to arrange columns to match their workflow patterns.

### SessionObjectTable for HTTP session-scoped storage

webforJ `25.03` introduces `SessionObjectTable`, a new addition to the existing `ObjectTable` and `StringTable` utilities. While the original tables provide environment-scoped storage for shared data across your application, `SessionObjectTable` brings HTTP session-scoped storage capabilities when running in Jakarta Servlet 6.1+ containers.

`SessionObjectTable` lets devs manage user-specific state in servlet environments, storing serializable objects that persist across all browser tabs and windows for a single user session. It provides the same static API methods like `put()`, `get()`, `contains()`, and `clear()`, but with session-level persistence. This is useful for managing authentication state, user preferences, and features like shopping carts across multiple tabs.

This addition completes the storage hierarchy in webforJ, giving you the right scoping tool for every need: `StringTable` for persistent configuration, `ObjectTable` for environment-scoped data, and now `SessionObjectTable` for true HTTP session management.

### Router Activate lifecycle event for cached components

Routing has had the `ActivateEvent` and `ActivateObserver` interfaces added to handle component reactivation. When users navigate back to a cached component, the `onActivate()` method fires, allowing you to refresh data while preserving component state â€“ developers will no longer be forced to choose between recreating entire components or manually checking for changes.

This feature shines in parameter-driven routes. Navigate from `/customer/123` to `/customer/456`, and the component stays cached while `onActivate` provides an opportunity to load new customer data. User inputs, form state, and expensive initializations all persist, while only the relevant data refreshes.

### Automatic browser launch for Spring Boot development

Finally, a little quality of life enhancement for developers - automatic browser launch has been added in webforJ `25.03`. When running Spring Boot applications in development mode, webforJ can now automatically open your default browser to the application URL, removing the need to manually type localhost addresses.

Configure this feature through simple application properties: enable it with `webforj.devtools.browser.open=true` and choose your preferred host resolution with `webforj.devtools.browser.host`. Whether you prefer `localhost`, your machine's hostname, or a specific IP address for remote access testing, the browser launcher can be configured for your development setup.

## Upgrade notes

When upgrading to `25.03`, be aware of the following:

- Spring Boot projects can now use the new configuration and scoping features
- Existing lifecycle hooks remain compatible with the new early lifecycle system
- Table components automatically support the new column features without code changes

`25.03` strengthens the webforJ's enterprise offerings with improved Spring integration and component behavior. We're excited to see what you build with these new features!

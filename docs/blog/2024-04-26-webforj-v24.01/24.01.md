# `24.01`

As always, see the [GitHub release overview](https://github.com/webforj/webforj/releases/tag/24.01) for a more comprehensive list of changes.

## New data binding feature in webforJ

webforJ `24.01` introduces a robust data binding capability, smoothly connecting UI components with backend data models in Java applications. This integration ensures that any changes made in the UI are immediately reflected in the data model and vice versa. This feature greatly simplifies data management and reduces time to completion. Below are some of the key features:

- **Bidirectional Binding**: Automatically synchronizes changes between the data model and the UI, ensuring that updates in one are mirrored in the other.

- **Comprehensive Validation**: Provides robust validation options that can be customized, allowing developers to implement custom rules or leverage existing validation frameworks like Jakarta Validation to maintain data accuracy.

- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable to support a wide range of UI components, data transformations, and complex validation needs.

- **Annotation-Based Configuration**: Reduces the need for repetitive code by using annotations to declare bindings, making the process more straightforward and easier to maintain.

For most cases, webforJ's data binding between UI component and data model can be done automatically. For more complex cases, tools have been provided to make the binding seamless and straightforward.

Functionality such as transformation and validation further enhance the binding capabilities to further simplify UI interaction with the data layer. For more information on this feature, see the [documentation entry](../../docs/data-binding/overview).

The latest `Login` component in webforJ offers an intuitive and efficient interface for user authentication, enabling users to log in using their username and password. This component is highly customizable to enhance user experiences across various devices and locales.

All of the features you'd expect from a `Login` component is included:

- **Intuitive Interface**: Provides clear input fields for username and password, a toggle for password visibility, and validation feedback to ensure proper formatting before submission.

- **Flexible and Extensible**: Easily extendable to include additional fields, such as Customer ID, and configurable to allow empty passwords if necessary.

- **Localization Support**: Fully customizable titles, descriptions, labels, and messages through the LoginI18n class, allowing for precise localization and personalization.

Using the `Login` component can help shave off development time, and provides and attractive and powerful entry point into applications. For a more detailed overview on the `Login` components, take a look at the [docs entry here](../docs/components/login).

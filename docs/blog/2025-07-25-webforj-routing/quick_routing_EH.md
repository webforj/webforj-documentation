We all know that feeling, you are browsing a website or webapp, make a simple missclick and instinctively try to go back or undo it. Only to then be somewhere completely else, worst case not even on the site anymore. 

With user experience being one of the most important factors in modern web development that scenario is one of the many reasons why a robust and well maintained routing system is so important for our SPA.

In this article i will give a quick overview on how to archieve that with webforJ. We will take a look at movement between views, preserving different states and in general intuitive interaction with our app. In around 10 Minutes you should be able to set up routes, handle advanced navigation scenarios and still follow the best practices for future maintenance.

## What is Routing? And what is an SPA?

Lets start off with the most important things first, what are we even talking about here. A Java SPA(Single Page Application) is using a single html page to dynamically update its content. This results in a faster and smoother user experience whilst posing the challenge of navigating these content updates. 

Thats where routing comes into play. Its the mechanism we use to navigate between different views or pages in said SPA without ever triggering a full page reload.

With webforj, routing is handled entirely in Java, allowing you to define navigation paths, manage state and control how users move through your app.

## Basic route setup - @Route annotation usage

Setting up routes in webforJ is very straightforward. The core of routing is the `@Route` annotation, which you place on your view classes to map them to specific URL paths. When a user navigates to a given path, webforJ automatically displays the corresponding view - no manual wiring required.

For example, to create a simple home page and an about page:

```java
@Route("")
public class HomeView extends Composite<Div> {
    // Home page content
}

@Route("about")
public class AboutView extends Composite<Div> {
    // About page content
}
```

With this setup, visiting "/" will show the HomeView, and "/about" will show the AboutView. You can add as many routes as you need, each mapped to its own Java class. 

## Advanced routing features - parameters, aliases, nested routes

Other than the very basic setup shown above you eventually come to the point where you need more advanced features. Of course webforJ also allows you implement those without much extra work. 

For route parameters, you can define those directly in the path, such as `@Route("user/:id")`. Using route parameters you can capture dynamic values from the URL and use them directly in your webforJ code. The way you do that is by utilizing the `ParametersBag` in navigation events so you can load data or update the UI based on the route.

For even more flexibility, use the `@RouteAlias` annotation to map multiple URLs to the same view. For example, a profile page can be accessible via both `/profile` and `/user/me` by annotating the class with both `@Route` and `@RouteAlias`.

Nested routes are handled using the outlet parameter in the `@Route` annotation, letting you build parent-child hierarchies. This allows you to inject child views into specific areas of a parent layout giving you free reign over your URL structures (e.g., /dashboard/settings).

## SEO and browser integration

WebforJ makes it easy to keep your app SEO-friendly and user-friendly by managing page titles and browser history automatically. Use the `@FrameTitle` annotation on your view classes to set the browser’s page title for each route. For example, `@FrameTitle("Dashboard")` ensures that when users navigate to the dashboard, the browser tab displays the correct title. If you set an app-wide title with `@AppTitle`, webforJ combines it with the frame title so everyone still knows where they currently are even if potentially tabbed away.

If you want your title to be dynamically set depending on things like route parameters or app stae you can simply implement the `HasFrameTitle` interface into your view. This will generate the the title based on those things for example for pages like user profiles, where the title should reflect the current user.

webforJ also manages browser history and deep linking out of the box. As users navigate, the URL updates without a full page reload, and the browser’s back/forward buttons work as expected. This directly prevents the user problems i described in my introduction but also makes sure your app is discoverable by search engines.

## Common patterns - Dashboard Routes, 404 Handling

A typical pattern in webforJ apps is to use a dedicated layout route for dashboards, with nested view routes for each dashboard section. For example, you might have a MainLayout class annotated with `@Route`, and then a `DashboardView` with `@Route(value = "/", outlet = MainLayout.class)` and `@RouteAlias(value = "/dashboard")`. This way you can utilize shared UI elements, like a drawer for navigation or headers, in the layout whilst you can freely change the content which is injected as children.

To handle unknown or invalid routes (404 errors), webforJ allows you to define a special “not found” view. You can register a fallback route or error handler that displays a custom message or page when users navigate to a non-existent path. This ensures your app always provides a clear, user-friendly experience—even when users mistype a URL or follow a broken link.

## Best practices 

- **Consistent Naming:** Name your route classes with clear, descriptive names that end in `View` for standard views and `Layout` for layout components. This helps webforJ auto-detect route types and keeps your code self-explanatory.
- **Logical Folder Structure:** Organize your views and layouts into folders by feature or section (e.g., `views/dashboard/`, `views/admin/`). This makes it easy to locate and manage related routes as your app grows.
- **Declarative Routing:** Use the `@Route` annotation for all routable components, and prefer static registration over dynamic unless you have advanced needs. Keep route paths simple, lowercase, and hyphenated (e.g., `/user-profile`).
- **Route Hierarchy:** Structure your routes hierarchically, using parent layouts for shared UI and child views for specific content.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each view or layout should have a focused purpose. Avoid mixing unrelated logic in a single component.
- **Type-Safe Navigation:** When navigating programmatically, use the view class rather than hardcoded strings. 

## Conclusion

We have now gone over how to build up routing in webforJ thats both easily maintainable and implemented as well as some structures to follow so that users can navigate through your app without any problems. Of course this article can't cover everything there is to know about routing and there would be more topics we could delve into like data binding and security but that would go beyond the scope of what we set out to do here. 

If you however want to check those topics out, feel free to look through our official [documentation](https://webforj.dev/docs/routing/overview) where you will find a plethora of different articles detailing everything you need to know about those topics as well.

As a next step, try building a small multi-view app to reinforce these concepts. Once you’re comfortable, explore more advanced topics like authentication flows, dynamic route registration, and custom navigation guards.

webforJ version `25.00` is out now! This release includes brand-new UI components, functional improvements, and key architectural updates. Let's walk through some of the most exciting additions.

<!-- truncate -->

# 25.00

## `Alert` component

A new `Alert` component has been added in webforJ `25.00`. This component provides contextual feedback messages for users, such as when displaying notifications, warnings, success confirmations, and more.

Alerts can be styled, themed, and optionally dismissed by the user.

#### Key features

- **Themes**: Use standard `Theme` values such as `DEFAULT`, `PRIMARY`, `SUCCESS`, `DANGER`, etc., to visually differentiate alerts.
- **Closable**: Set alerts to be dismissible by the user with `setClosable(true)`.
- **Visibility control**: Show or hide the alert using `open()` and `close()`.
- **Expanse support**: Use `setExpanse()` to control the sizing (e.g., `SMALL`, `MEDIUM`, `LARGE`).
- **Content flexibility**: Use `setText()` for plain messages, or `addToContent()` to embed components inside the alert.
- **Event handling**: Listen for when the alert is closed by the user using `onClose()` method.

#### Example usage

```java
Alert alert = new Alert("Profile updated successfully!", Theme.SUCCESS)
  .setClosable(true)
  .setExpanse(Expanse.SMALL)
  .onClose(e -> {
    System.out.println("Alert dismissed by user.");
  });

mainFrame.add(alert);
```

## `InfiniteScroll` & `Refresher` components

In addition to the `Alert` component, two additional components have been introduced in this release which are designed to interact with dynamic data: the `InfiniteScroll` and the `Refresher` components. These components aim to make interaction with dynamic data more efficient, and align with what users expect in a modern web app.

### `InfiniteScroll`

If using the pagination is undesirable in your app, the `InfiniteScroll` component is a perfect fit. This component allows content to load continuously as the user scrolls down a pageand is perfect for use cases like social feeds, product listings, or any scenario where data is retrieved in batches.

#### Key features

- **Automatic loading**: Trigger data fetching when the user nears the bottom of the viewport.
- **Customizable indicator**: Override the loading state with custom content using `addToContent()`.
- **Icon and message control**: Change the spinner or loading text with `setIcon()` and `setText()`.
- **Manual completion**: Stop further loading by calling `.setCompleted(true)` when there's no more data.
- **Scroll event handling**: React to the scroll trigger with `onScroll()` to load new data chunks.

#### Example usage

```java
InfiniteScroll scroll = new InfiniteScroll("Loading more customers...");
scroll.onScroll(event -> {
  // Fetch and add more content here
});
```

After loading new content, simply call `update()` to reset the component and prepare for the next scroll trigger.

### `Refresher`

The `Refresher` component brings native-like pull-to-refresh capability to webforJ apps, ideal for mobile devices. This addition further builds on webforJ’s mobile support - especially when paired with [installable apps](../../docs/configuration/installable-apps), introduced in [24.21](../2025-01-27-webforj-v24.21/24.21). Together, they allow you to build apps that look and feel native, in Java.

#### Key features

- **Touch-based refresh**: Triggers an event when the user pulls down from the top of the screen. This event can be used to reload data, perform updates, etc.

- **Customizable Icons**: You can define which icons appear during each stage of the refresh gesture:

  - `setArrowIcon()`: Shown while the user pulls down.

  - `setRefreshIcon()`: Displayed while data is refreshing.

- **Thresholds**: Customize how far the user must pull before triggering a refresh:

  - `setThreshold()`: Minimum distance (in pixels) required to enter the "release to refresh" state.

  - `setThresholdMax()`: Maximum pull distance to cap how far the component can stretch.

- **Themeable**: Integrates with your app’s look using `setTheme()`.

#### Example usage

```java
Refresher refresher = new Refresher();
refresher.onRefresh(event -> {
  // Reload your data or perform updates
  refresher.finish(); // Always call when the refresh action is complete
});
```

## `Table` enhancements

The `25.00` release brings two new features to the `Table` component: conditional styling and multi-column sorting. These additions give more control over the appearance and behavior of tables.

### Conditional styling

Tables can now dynamically style individual rows and cells based on the data they represent. With the new `setRowPartProvider()` and `setCellPartProvider()` methods, you can apply custom CSS part names to rows and cells, enabling styles like conditional highlighting or state indicators.


```java
// Apply alternating row styles
table.setRowPartProvider(person -> {
  int index = data.indexOf(person);
  return List.of(index % 2 == 0 ? "row-even" : "row-odd");
});

// Apply CSS styling to the dwc-table::part
```

```css
dwc-table::part(row-even) {
  background-color: var(--dwc-color-default);
}
```

### Multi-column sorting

Sorting in tables has been overhauled in this release. By default, tables now use single-column sorting—clicking a column header will sort that column and clear sorting from others.

If your app needs more flexibility, multi-column sorting can now be enabled with:

```java
table.setMultiSorting(true);
```

When active, users can sort by multiple columns in a defined order. The sorted columns are visually numbered to indicate their sort precedence, helping to clarify information display in more complex tables.

For server-side sorting, you can define sort priority programmatically:

```java
column1.setSortIndex(1); // Highest priority
column2.setSortIndex(2); // Secondary
```

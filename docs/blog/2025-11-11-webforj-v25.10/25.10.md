webforJ version `25.10` introduces some heavy hitting new capabilities for building global, secure, and integrated applications. This release brings internationalization support, enterprise-grade security which includes Spring Security integration, Webswing compatibility for legacy Java Swing apps, and adds to our `Login` component.

As always, see the [GitHub release overview](https://github.com/webforj/webforj/releases/tag/25.10) for a more comprehensive list of changes. Highlighted below are some of the most exciting changes:

## Route Security with Spring Security integration

webforJ `25.10` introduces **Route Security** - a declarative security system that protects your routes with simple annotations. Whether using this in tandem with the integrated Spring Security support, or implementing an existing or custom solution, you no longer need to implement authentication checks or complex authorization layers. Just annotate your routes, and the framework handles the rest.

```java title="Protecting routes with annotations"
@Route("/login")
@AnonymousAccess // Public access
public class LoginView extends Composite<Login> { }

@Route("/dashboard")
public class DashboardView extends Composite<Div> { } // Requires authentication

@Route("/admin")
@RolesAllowed("ADMIN") // Requires ADMIN role
public class AdminView extends Composite<Div> { }
```

Spring Security is supported out of the box for teams using Spring Boot, and is recommended for those starting a new project. It's built on an extensible architecture that works with custom authentication systems too. Use [SpEL expressions](/docs/security/spel-expressions) for complex authorization logic, create [custom evaluators](/docs/security/custom-evaluators) for business-specific rules, and enable secure-by-default mode to require authentication for all routes unless explicitly marked public.

## Webswing integration for progressive modernization

Have a legacy Java Swing app that needs web access? webforJ `25.10` introduces **Webswing integration**, which lets you embed existing Swing applications directly in your webforJ apps with zero code changes to the Swing app itself.

```java
@Route
public class SwingAppView extends Composite<Div> {
  public SwingAppView() {
    WebswingConnector connector = new WebswingConnector("http://localhost:8080/myapp/");
    connector.setSize("100%", "600px");
    getBoundComponent().add(connector);
  }
}
```

The new `WebswingConnector` component streams your Swing app to browsers, giving users immediate web access. But here's the exciting part: you can incrementally replace Swing components with modern webforJ equivalents at your own pace. 

Start by embedding the entire app, then gradually modernize high-value components like forms and dialogs while preserving critical business logic. Bidirectional communication keeps both sides synchronized throughout the journey.

## Internationalization and localization support

Building global applications just got easier. webforJ `25.10` introduces a **localization system** with automatic locale change notifications. Implement the `LocaleObserver` interface in your components, and they'll automatically receive updates when users switch languages - no manual event wiring required.

When your app calls `App.setLocale()`, every component implementing `LocaleObserver` gets notified instantly. The system works seamlessly with Java's `ResourceBundle` API for traditional property file translations, but you can also load translations from databases, REST APIs, or any custom source. One line of code triggers coordinated updates across your entire application - navigation menus, forms, dialogs, everything.

## Login component enhancements

The `Login` component gets two key upgrades that pair perfectly with the new Route Security system. First, form action support via `setAction()` enables traditional POST-based authentication - just point it at your Spring Security endpoint and it handles the rest. Second, custom fields support lets you extend authentication workflows with department codes, 2FA tokens, tenant identifiers, or whatever your auth system requires. Both enhancements maintain full backward compatibility with existing `onSubmit()` handlers.

## Upgrade notes

When upgrading to `25.10`, be aware of the following:

[Upgrade notes to be added]

`25.10` represents a significant step forward for webforJ, bringing enterprise-grade features that enable building secure, global, and integrated applications. We're excited to see what you build with these new capabilities!

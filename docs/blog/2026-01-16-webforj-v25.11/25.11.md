The new year brings a new version of webforJ - introducing version 25.11! This release brings polished animations, AI-ready components, and faster ways to prototype. The new View Transitions API adds smooth animations to route navigation with a single annotation. [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/) integration lets you run webforJ apps from a single file—no project setup required. Two new components join the library: `Avatar` for user profiles and `MarkdownViewer` for streaming content with progressive rendering, perfect for AI chat interfaces. Round it out with a `Debouncer` utility, a minify plugin for smaller builds, improved Spring Boot integration, and additions to our docs and demos.

As always, see the [GitHub release overview](https://github.com/webforj/webforj/releases/tag/25.11) for a more comprehensive list of changes. Highlighted below are some of the most exciting additions:

## View Transitions API for animated route navigation

Changing views is an incredibly common occurrence in apps, often made more visually appealing by adding transitions. Before, these transitions required complex CSS. Now, webforJ introduces experimental support for the browser's native [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API), bringing smooth animations to navigation with minimal effort.

<video src="https://cdn.webforj.com/webforj-documentation/blogs/webforj-v25.11/transitions.mov" autoPlay muted loop playsInline style={{width: '100%', borderRadius: '8px', marginBottom: '1rem'}}></video>

The simplest approach, and the one used in the above video is the `@RouteTransition` annotation:

```java
@Route
@RouteTransition(enter = ViewTransition.SLIDE_LEFT, exit = ViewTransition.SLIDE_RIGHT)
public class DetailView extends Composite<Div> {
    // ...
}
```

That's it—the router handles the animation automatically. Built-in transitions include `FADE`, `SLIDE_LEFT`, `SLIDE_RIGHT`, `SLIDE_UP`, `SLIDE_DOWN`, `ZOOM`, and `ZOOM_OUT`. For more control, a programmatic API lets you orchestrate transitions manually, including shared element transitions that morph matching elements between views.

## JBang integration for instant prototyping

Want to try a webforJ idea without worrying about scaffolding a whole new Java project? Now you can. The new **JBang integration** lets you write and run small webforJ apps in just a single file, without config files and lots of installations—no `pom.xml`, no project structure, no build configuration. Just install JBang, add the dependency directive, and run.

<video src="https://cdn.webforj.com/webforj-documentation/blogs/webforj-v25.11/jbang.mov" autoPlay muted loop playsInline style={{width: '100%', borderRadius: '8px', marginBottom: '1rem'}}></video>

```java
///usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $?
//DEPS com.webforj:webforj-jbang-starter:25.11
//JAVA 21

@SpringBootApplication
public class Counter extends App {
  private int count = 0;

  @Override
  public void run() throws WebforjException {
    Frame frame = new Frame();
    H1 counter = new H1("0");
    Button btn = new Button("Click me", e -> counter.setText(String.valueOf(++count)));
    frame.add(FlexLayout.create(counter, btn).vertical().build());
  }
}
```

Run `jbang Counter.java` and your browser opens automatically—perfect for rapid prototyping and learning webforJ.

## Avatar component

Profiles, comments, team lists, activity feeds - user avatars show up everywhere. The new **Avatar** component makes them trivial to implement:

```java
// Auto-generated initials from name
Avatar avatar = new Avatar("John Doe"); // Shows "JD"

// With a profile image
Avatar avatar = new Avatar("Jane Smith");
avatar.add(new Img("https://example.com/profile.jpg"));
```

Pass a name and the `Avatar` generates initials automatically. Add an image as a child for photos instead. Seven themes, two shapes, and multiple sizes cover common cases.

See the [Avatar component docs](/docs/components/avatar) for themes, shapes, and customization options.

## Markdown Viewer component

AI interfaces have raised the bar for how users expect to see streamed content - text should appear progressively, not dump all at once. The new **MarkdownViewer** component brings that experience to webforJ with built-in progressive rendering support.

<video src="https://cdn.webforj.com/webforj-documentation/blogs/webforj-v25.11/ghsot-ai.mov" autoPlay muted loop playsInline style={{width: '100%', borderRadius: '8px', marginBottom: '1rem'}}></video>

*The video above showcases the MarkdownViewer rendering streamed output from an AI chatbot in real time.*

:::tip AI Autocompletion
Notice the text area in the demo? It features AI-powered autocompletion that suggests text as you type. This ghost text functionality is also available in the TextField and TextArea components - see [TextField documentation](/docs/components/fields/text-field) for details on enabling suggestions in your own apps.
:::

```java
MarkdownViewer viewer = new MarkdownViewer();
viewer.setProgressiveRender(true);
viewer.setAutoScroll(true);

// As chunks arrive from your AI service...
aiService.stream(prompt).subscribe(chunk -> {
    viewer.append(chunk);
});
```

Each `append()` call adds content to the stream. Auto-scroll keeps the latest content visible—smart enough to pause when users scroll up. Code blocks get syntax highlighting automatically. The API includes `setRenderSpeed()`, `stop()`, `flush()`, and `whenRenderComplete()` for full control.

## `Debouncer` utility

Ever notice how search-as-you-type can hammer your server with requests on every keystroke? The new **`Debouncer`** utility solves this and other similar issues - it waits until the user pauses before executing, so you only process what matters.

```java
Debouncer debounce = new Debouncer(0.3f);

textField.onModify(e -> {
    debounce.run(() -> search(textField.getText()));
});
```

Type as fast as you want—the search only fires after 300ms of inactivity. The API includes `flush()` for immediate execution, `cancel()` to abort, and `isPending()` to check status.

:::info Learn More
See the [Debouncer docs](/docs/advanced/debouncing) for control methods and cleanup patterns.

## Minify plugin for build-time asset optimization

Add a plugin to your build, ship smaller bundles. The new **webforJ minify plugin** compresses CSS and JavaScript files automatically during compilation.

There's nothing new to configure - the plugin discovers assets through your existing `@StyleSheet` and `@JavaScript` annotations. It skips files that are already minified and processes larger projects in parallel. Maven and Gradle are both supported.

:::info Learn More
See the [Minify plugin docs](/docs/configuration/minifier-plugin) for setup instructions and configuration options.
:::

## Route Registry Provider SPI

The new **RouteRegistryProvider SPI** lets frameworks like Spring plug in their own route discovery logic. For most developers, this is invisible—routes just work. But if you're building framework integrations, you now have a clean extension point.

## Spring Boot starter simplification

A small but welcome change: the `webforj-spring-boot-starter` now includes webforJ as a transitive dependency. Previously you needed to declare both the starter and the core library separately. Now just add the starter and you're done—one dependency instead of two.


## Built with webforJ: Demo applications

We're continuing to add open source demo applications. Clone, run, and learn from these projects:

### ghost:ai

A ChatGPT-style AI chat application built with Spring AI and Google Gemini. Features streaming markdown rendering, predictive ghost text suggestions, conversation memory, and MCP server integration. This demo combines many 25.11 features—`MarkdownViewer`, ghost text API, and `Debouncer`—into one cohesive app.

### REST Pagination

A comparison of two pagination strategies: `CollectionRepository` for client-side pagination of small datasets versus `DelegatingRepository` for lazy-loading large datasets on demand.

## Documentation enhancements

The docs received some attention this release too:

- **Revamped component articles** - The [Component Fundamentals](/docs/building-ui/component-fundamentals) article has been rewritten with a comprehensive overview of the component model, lifecycle, and best practices.

- **AI-powered search** - The documentation site now features AI search. Ask natural language questions about webforJ and get relevant answers drawn from across the documentation, complete with links to the source material.

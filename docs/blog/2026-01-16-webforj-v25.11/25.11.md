Version `25.11` of webforJ is live! In this release, we've focused on polishing how users see your app, with built-in visual transitions, AI-ready components, and faster ways to prototype and learn about webforJ. See some of the most exciting highlights below, and as always, see the [GitHub release overview](https://github.com/webforj/webforj/releases/tag/25.11) for a more comprehensive list of changes.

## Transitions

Starting with one of the most exciting and powerful changes, webforJ now wraps the browser's native [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API), allowing developers to easily use smooth animations for any UI change.

### View Transition API

The programmatic API handles any DOM update—reordering lists, swapping content, or toggling visibility. All a developer needs to do is use `Page.getCurrent().startViewTransition()`, which returns a builder for configuring the transition:

```java
Page.getCurrent().startViewTransition()
    .onUpdate(done -> {
        container.remove(oldView);
        container.add(newView);
        done.run();
    })
    .start();
```

Elements with matching transition names animate smoothly between states, with the browser handling the animation automatically.

### Route transitions

For navigation between routes, the `@RouteTransition` annotation provides a declarative approach built on the same underlying API:

```java
@Route
@RouteTransition(enter = ViewTransition.SLIDE_LEFT, exit = ViewTransition.SLIDE_RIGHT)
public class DetailView extends Composite<Div> { }
```

Built-in options include `NONE`, `FADE`, `SLIDE_LEFT`, `SLIDE_RIGHT`, `SLIDE_UP`, `SLIDE_DOWN`, `ZOOM`, and `ZOOM_OUT`.

## New components

In addition to easy and aesthetic transitions, `25.11` adds two new components that handle common UI patterns.

### Avatar

User avatars appear everywhere - profiles, comments, team lists. This is a common component that's present in nearly all modern web apps where users log in. For this reason, the new **Avatar** component makes adding them simple:

```java
// Auto-generated initials from name
Avatar avatar = new Avatar("John Doe"); // Shows "JD"

// With a profile image
Avatar avatar = new Avatar("Jane Smith");
avatar.add(new Img("https://example.com/profile.jpg"));
```

Passing a name to the `Avatar` generates initials automatically. To use photos, simply add an image as a child element. The `Avatar` comes with seven themes, two shapes, and multiple sizes to cover common cases.

See the [Avatar component docs](/docs/components/avatar) for themes, shapes, and customization options.

### Markdown Viewer

Rounding out the new components added in `25.11` is the `MarkdownViewer`. New tools such as AI chat interfaces have set new expectations for streamed content, where text should appear progressively, not dump onto a page all at once. **MarkdownViewer** brings that experience to webforJ:

<video src="https://cdn.webforj.com/webforj-documentation/blogs/webforj-v25.11/ghsot-ai.mov" autoPlay muted loop playsInline style={{width: '100%', borderRadius: '8px', marginBottom: '1rem'}}></video>

*The video above showcases the `MarkdownViewer` rendering streamed output from an AI chatbot in real time.*

:::tip AI Autocompletion
Notice the text area in the demo? It features AI-powered autocompletion that suggests text as you type. This ghost text functionality is also available in the `TextArea` component—see [TextArea documentation](/docs/components/textarea#predicted-text) for details on enabling suggestions in your own apps.
:::

```java
MarkdownViewer viewer = new MarkdownViewer();
viewer.setProgressiveRender(true);
viewer.setAutoScroll(true);

// As chunks arrive from an AI service...
aiService.stream(prompt).subscribe(chunk -> {
    viewer.append(chunk);
});
```

Each `append()` call adds content to the stream. Auto-scroll keeps the latest content visible—smart enough to pause when users scroll up. Code blocks get syntax highlighting automatically. The API includes `setRenderSpeed()`, `stop()`, `flush()`, and `whenRenderComplete()` for full control.

## Build and tooling

Along with additions to the UI in version `25.11`, the following build and tooling integrations and enhancements have been added to make developing with webforJ even faster and more efficient:

### Minify plugin

To help developers ship smaller bundles with zero configuration, the new **webforJ minify plugin** compresses CSS and JavaScript files automatically during compilation, discovering assets through your existing `@StyleSheet` and `@JavaScript` annotations.

:::info Learn More
See the [Minify plugin docs](/docs/configuration/minifier-plugin) for setup instructions.
:::

### JBang integration

Continuing with the theme of developer efficiency and ease, we've integrated **[JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/)**, which lets you run webforJ apps from a single file, no `pom.xml`, no build configuration.

<video src="https://cdn.webforj.com/webforj-documentation/blogs/webforj-v25.11/jbang.mov" autoPlay muted loop playsInline style={{width: '100%', borderRadius: '8px', marginBottom: '1rem'}}></video>

```java
///usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $?
//DEPS com.webforj:webforj-jbang-starter:25.11
//JAVA 21

package bang;

import com.webforj.App;
import com.webforj.annotation.Routify;
import com.webforj.component.Composite;
import com.webforj.component.Theme;
import com.webforj.component.button.Button;
import com.webforj.component.button.ButtonTheme;
import com.webforj.component.field.TextField;
import com.webforj.component.icons.FeatherIcon;
import com.webforj.component.layout.flexlayout.FlexDirection;
import com.webforj.component.layout.flexlayout.FlexLayout;
import com.webforj.component.toast.Toast;
import com.webforj.router.annotation.Route;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
@Routify
public class HelloWorld extends App {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(HelloWorld.class, args);
  }
}

@Route("/")
class MainView extends Composite<FlexLayout> {

  private FlexLayout self = getBoundComponent();
  private TextField hello = new TextField("What is your name?");
  private Button btn = new Button("Say Hello");

  public MainView() {
    self.setDirection(FlexDirection.COLUMN);
    self.setMaxWidth(300);
    self.setStyle("margin", "1em auto");

    btn.setPrefixComponent(FeatherIcon.BELL.create())
        .setTheme(ButtonTheme.PRIMARY)
        .addClickListener(e -> Toast.show("Welcome to webforJ JBang Starter " + hello.getValue() + "!", Theme.GRAY));

    self.add(hello, btn);
  }
}
```

Run `jbang HelloWorld.java` and your browser opens automatically. This integration is designed for learning, prototyping, and testing small ideas, not production apps. When your prototype outgrows a single file, transition to a [full Maven project](/docs/integrations/spring/spring-boot).

## Also in this release

The following enhancements also bear mentioning for those building apps with `25.11`:

### `Debouncer` utility

The new `Debouncer` class delays execution until input pauses, which is perfect for search-as-you-type scenarios where you want to wait until the user stops typing before executing a search:

```java
Debouncer debounce = new Debouncer(0.3f); // 300ms delay

textField.onModify(e -> {
  debounce.run(() -> search(textField.getText()));
});
```

Each call to `run()` resets the timer. The API also includes `cancel()` to abort pending actions, `flush()` to execute immediately, and `isPending()` to check state.

### Spring Boot starter simplification

Starting with `25.11`, the `webforj-spring-boot-starter` includes all core webforJ dependencies transitively. Where you previously needed two dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.webforj</groupId>
    <artifactId>webforj</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.webforj</groupId>
    <artifactId>webforj-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

You now need only one:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.webforj</groupId>
    <artifactId>webforj-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### RouteRegistryProvider SPI

The new `RouteRegistryProvider` Service Provider Interface lets integration frameworks provide custom route discovery mechanisms. This enables frameworks to integrate their own classpath scanning and dependency injection systems with webforJ's routing infrastructure. See the [RouteRegistryProvider docs](/docs/advanced/route-registry-provider) for implementation details.

## Demo applications

Many of the above features, as well as other important design paradigms and practices, are outlined in our [built-with-webforJ repository](https://github.com/webforj/built-with-webforj), which contains a myriad of projects that developers can use to learn from. The following three projects have been added this release:

### [Focus Tracker](https://github.com/webforj/built-with-webforj/tree/main/webforj-focustracker)

A Pomodoro timer showcasing PWA capabilities: installable apps, native notifications, and badge updates.

### [ghost:ai](https://github.com/webforj/built-with-webforj/tree/main/webforj-ghostai) 

A ChatGPT-style chat app combining `MarkdownViewer`, and "spooky" text suggestions using the `TextArea` autocomplete behavior.

### [REST Pagination](https://github.com/webforj/built-with-webforj/tree/main/webforj-rest) 

Compares `CollectionRepository` (client-side) versus `DelegatingRepository` (lazy-loading) pagination strategies.

## Documentation updates

Finally, the following enhancements have been made to the docs site, making sure that developers building with webforJ can find the right information for their job as quickly as possible:

- **[Component Fundamentals](/docs/building-ui/component-fundamentals)** rewritten with comprehensive coverage of the component model and lifecycle, a great starting place for developers wanting to understand the fundamental building blocks of webforJ
- **AI-powered search** added to the docs—ask natural language questions and get answers with source links, reducing the need to search through articles yourself.

One of the great benefits of creating web apps is gaining access to the powerful styling and layout capabilities of CSS. 
In particular, CSS lets you create responsive layouts, allowing your apps to smoothly adjust their layout according to parameters like window size and device type. 
Apps with responsive layouts look and feel better, and they allow users to use your app in their preferred context and size.
With webforJ, you have that power in Java!

But, knowing what to do with that power is another story. 
Perhaps you're used to carefully laying out forms with a rigid structure, and the prospect of creating designs that are adaptable and dynamic seems intimidating and complicated. 
So where do you start? 
With webforJ's [`FlexLayout`](https://docs.webforj.com/docs/components/flex-layout)!

## `FlexLayout` fundamentals
The `FlexLayout` component is a powerful layout tool based on CSS FlexBox. 
It can create responsive layout designs that adapt to the available space and number of elements in a natural way. 
`FlexLayout` shares its terminology and conceptual structure with FlexBox, so if you're a seasoned CSS pro, your existing knowledge will apply just as well in webforJ.

### Translating from Flexbox to `FlexLayout`
So, if webforJ's `FlexLayout` provides the same functionality as CSS Flexbox, how does one translate to the other?
If you've used Flexbox before, `FlexLayout` will be a familiar tool with different syntax.
Instead of writing CSS like `justify-content: space-between;` you will use object methods and enums to write Java code such as `layout.SetJustifyContent(FlexJustifyContent.BETWEEN);`.

| Function | CSS Flexbox | webforJ `FlexLayout` |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Flex Container** | An HTML element with the `display` attribute set to `flex`. | A `FlexLayout` component, created with the `FlexLayoutBuilder`. |
| **Flex Items** | Child elements of the container are items in the container. | Add components with the `add(component)` method, or create the `FlexLayout` with a list of components to include. |
| **Properties and Values** | Set CSS properties such as `justify-content` or `flex-wrap` on the container or items, using values like `space-evenly` or `wrap`. | Use FlexLayout methods such as `setJustifyContent()` or `setWrap()` to set specific properties, using enums like `FlexJustifyContent.EVENLY` or `FlexWrap.WRAP`. |

### Creating a `FlexLayout`
To create a FlexLayout, use the `FlexLayout.create()` method to create a `FlexLayoutBuilder`, and use the `build()` method to build it:

```java
FlexLayout flex = FlexLayout.create().build();
```

When creating a `FlexLayout`, you can set some properties right away with methods like `wrap()`, `horizontal()`, `vertical()`, and more. 
See the
<JavadocLink type="flexlayout" location="com/webforj/component/layout/flexlayout/FlexLayoutBuilder" code="true">FlexLayoutBuilder</JavadocLink>
Javadocs for a full list of methods.

### Populating your `FlexLayout`
To add a component to a `FlexLayout`, just use the `add()` method:

```java
flex.add(new Button("A button in a FlexLayout"));
```

You can also add all the components right away when you create the `FlexLayout` by supplying a list of components in the constructor.
## `FlexLayout` container cheatsheet
Configuration is where the real power of `FlexLayout` shines, because different configurations will yield very different behavior. 
It can sometimes be difficult to wrap your head around the various configuration options, so visual cheatsheets are an invaluable resource. 
Luckily, that's exactly what we have here!

When configuring a `FlexLayout`, you can set properties on the `FlexLayout` itself (the container) or on the individual items within it. 
This post focuses on configuring the `FlexLayout` container. 
A `FlexLayout` has a **main axis** and a **cross axis**, and you can configure them independently.

### The main axis
The main axis is the primary axis on which the items in a `FlexLayout` appear, and can be either horizontal (row) or vertical (column), depending on the direction setting. 
You can configure the main axis direction, wrapping, and item positioning.

#### `setDirection()`
You can control the direction of the main axis with `setDirection()`, which corresponds to the CSS property `flex-direction`. 
The image below shows the four possible values of the `FlexDirection` enum. 
Each series of boxes is a `FlexLayout`, and the number corresponds to the order the element was added. 
For `ROW` and `COLUMN`, the items appear in order from left to right or top to bottom, but for `ROW_REVERSE` and `COLUMN_REVERSE`, they are reversed:

#### `setWrap()`
Wrapping content is one of the greatest benefits of the `FlexLayout`. 
With wrapping enabled, content that doesn't fit in a single line moves to the next line in the direction of the cross axis, so your layout can adapt to different screen sizes. 
You can configure wrapping with the `setWrap()` method, which corresponds to the CSS property `flex-wrap`. 
:::note
By default, wrapping is disabled.
:::
The image below shows the three possible values of the `FlexWrap` enum.

#### `setJustifyContent()`
You can control the alignment of items along the main axis with `setJustifyContent()`, which corresponds to the CSS property `justify-content`. 
The image below shows all the possible values of the `FlexJustifyContent` enum in horizontal layouts. 
:::tip
Remember that in a column layout, `setJustifyContent()` controls the vertical alignment of items instead of the horizontal alignment.
:::

### The cross axis
The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis, so it is either horizontal or vertical, whichever is the opposite of the direction set on the main axis. 
You can configure how individual items and multiple lines are positioned along the cross axis.

#### `setAlignment()`
You can control how individual items are aligned along the cross axis with `setAlignment()`, which corresponds to the CSS property `align-items`. 
The following image shows all the possible values of the `FlexAlignment` enum in horizontal layouts for items of varying sizes. 
:::tip
Notice how the `BASELINE` alignment depends on text size, because the items are aligned according to the text baseline.
:::

#### `setAlignContent()`
If wrapping is enabled, you may have multiple lines of content, each with their own main and cross axes. 
To control the alignment of the **lines** of content, use `setAlignContent()`, which corresponds to the CSS property `align-content`. 
In the image below, every value of the `FlexContentAlignment` enum is used to arrange three lines of items within horizontal layouts with wrapping enabled.

## Summary
By using `setDirection()`, `setWrap()`, and `setJustifyContent()` on the main axis, and `setAlignment()` and `setAlignContent()` on the cross axis, you can exert a great deal of control over the placement of content in your app, while letting `FlexLayout` handle the complicated specifics of positioning and sizing automatically.

# 24.21

Highlighted below are some of the most important and exciting changes coming to webforJ in the `24.21` release:

## New features and enhancements ðŸŽ‰

We're thrilled to announce the latest version of webforJ, version `24.21`!. This release introduces powerful new features, three of which are highlighted below: installable apps, new modal dialogs for saving files, and a collection of exciting new archetypes for quick project scaffolding.

### Installable Apps

<!-- vale on -->

With this release, webforJ makes it easy to turn your web apps into installable applications. Installable web apps integrate with the device's operating system, appearing on the home screen or app menu and functioning similar to native apps.

Enabling this feature is straightforward - use the new `@AppProfile` annotation, and configure key details such as app name, icons, screenshots, and behavior. Here's a glimpse of what you can achieve:

<div class="videos-container">
  <video controls>
    <source src="/video/install-android.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
  </video>
</div>

To make use of this new feature, webforJ introduces the `@AppProfile` annotation - at a minimum, youâ€™ll need to specify the app's full name and short name, a concise name for limited-space contexts. Beyond this, you can customize various aspects of the appâ€™s appearance and behavior with optional properties.

See [this article](../../docs/configuration/installable-apps) for more information about this exciting new feature.

### `FileSaveDialog`

`24.21` also introduces the new `FileSaveDialog` component - a versatile modal dialog that lets users save files to specific locations on the server file system. Designed for simplicity and configurability, this dialog ensures users can specify file names and paths with ease. This component comes with the following key features:

- **Customizable behavior**: Define how the dialog handles existing files, asking for confirmation, overwriting, or showing an error dialog.

- **Flexible selection modes**: Allow users to save files, directories, or both.

- **Internationalization**: Fully localizable with the `FileSaveI18n` class, enabling multilingual support.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use the `FileSaveDialog`:

```java
String result = OptionDialog.showFileSaveDialog(
    "Save your file", "/home/user/documents", "report.xls"
);

if (result != null) {
    OptionDialog.showMessageDialog("Saved file to: " + result, "Path Selected");
} else {
    OptionDialog.showMessageDialog("No path selected", "Path Selected",
      MessageDialog.MessageType.ERROR);
}
```

### New webforJ archetype options

To help you get your webforJ project started faster, three new archetypes have been added to cater to different project needs:

<!-- vale off -->

- **Blank archetype**: Kickstart your app with a blank slate! The blank archetype provides a minimal project structure, giving you complete control over how your app is built. This archetype is ideal for developers who want to design their app architecture without predefined constraints or scaffolding.
<!-- vale on -->

<!-- ![cover image](../../static/release_blog/_images/blank_archetype.png) -->

- **SideMenu archetype**: Many apps require a structured navigation system. The side menu archetype comes with a prebuilt layout featuring a collapsible side menu and a content area. Itâ€™s perfect for apps that require clear, intuitive navigation across multiple sections.

<!-- ![cover image](../../static/release_blog/_images/sidemenu_archetype.png) -->

- **Tabs archetype**: Create apps with a simple, clean tabbed interface. This archetype is great for organizing content into sections that users can easily switch between, making it ideal for multi-view applications and a viable alternative to a `SideMenu` project.

<!-- ![cover image](../../static/release_blog/_images/tabs_archetype.png) -->

All of these archetypes come in addition to the previous `hello-world` archetype, which provided minimal scaffolding, but still more than the new `blank` archetype contains.
<Carousel navButtonsAlwaysVisible={true}>
  <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
    <h2>Blank archetype</h2>
    <img src={image1}/>
  </div>
  <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
    <h2>Tabs archetype</h2>
    <img src={image2}/>
  </div>
  <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
    <h2>Sidemenu archetype</h2>
    <img src={image3}/>
  </div>
</Carousel>
<br />

For more information on all of these archetypes, see [this section](../../docs/building-ui/archetypes/overview) of the documentation.

## Breaking changes ðŸ› 

This release introduces a few changes that may require updates to your existing code. The following are of particular note:

1) `BBjWindowAdapter` and `Panel` Marked as `final`
The `BBjWindowAdapter` and `Panel` classes are now declared as `final`, meaning they can no longer be subclassed. This change improves stability and enforces consistent usage patterns.

2) Refactored `getWebforjHelper()` Method
The `getWebforjHelper()` method has been replaced with `getBridge()`. If your app relies on `getWebforjHelper()`, update your code to use the new `getBridge()` method to ensure compatibility.

:::important `getWebforjHelper()` deprecation
The `getWebforjHelper()` method is deprecated and marked for removal in a future version.

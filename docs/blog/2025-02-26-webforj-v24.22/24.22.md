# 24.22

Highlighted below are some of the most exciting features coming in this release:

## Namespaces: Organize and scope data in your apps

The latest release introduces the `Namespace`, a feature designed to manage app-wide and user-specific data in an organized and structured way. By leveraging namespaces, developers can create isolated variable domains that different parts of an app can interact with efficiently.

Namespaces allow you to define scoped storage areas where app variables and state can be managed without conflicts. These scopes provide structured ways to share data between different parts of an app while maintaining separation where necessary.

**Using the `Namespace` feature , webforJ apps can now**:

- Share data across sessions (where applicable).
- Create private or group-specific data domains.
- Manage variable access events through listeners.

### Types of namespaces in webforJ

webforJ provides several types of namespaces, each offering different levels of accessibility and scope:

| **Namespace Type**    | **Scope**          | **Shared Between**                    | **Key Characteristics** |
|----------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Private Namespace** | Limited         | Clients that share the same prefix and name | Ideal for **isolated storage**, ensuring only intended users can access it. Requires both a `prefix` and `name`. |
| **Group Namespace**   | Application-wide | Threads started from the same parent | Enables **data sharing between related processes** while keeping it isolated from other app instances. |
| **Global Namespace**  | Server-wide     | All application server threads      | Fully **shared across the server**, making it useful for managing **global variables** and system-wide states. |


### Namespaces in action: Tic-Tac-Toe demo ðŸŽ®

While full documentation is coming soon, you can see namespaces in action with our Tic-Tac-Toe demo. This project showcases how namespaces can be used to manage game state, ensuring players can interact with a synchronized, isolated game session.

## Icons URL protocol

[webforJ 24.21](../2025-01-27-webforj-v24.21/24.21) introduced **installable apps**, allowing web apps to function more like native applications when installed on a device. 

Now, in `24.22`, this feature has been further enhanced by adding support for the `ws://` URL protocol in icons, enabling on-the-fly icon size generation.

### What is the `icons://` protocol?
The `icons://` protocol provides a dynamic approach to icon management, allowing icons to be generated and served automatically based on requested filenames and parameters. Instead of manually creating and storing multiple icon sizes, webforJ can now generate them as needed, reducing file storage overhead while ensuring icons remain optimized across devices.

This new protocol comes with many benefits, some of which include:

- **Automatic Icon Scaling** - No need to manually generate multiple icon sizes.
- **Efficient Storage** - Icons are created dynamically instead of being stored statically.
- **Seamless Integration with Installable Apps** - Works effortlessly with the @AppProfile annotation.
- **Customizable Appearance** - Fine-tune padding, background color, and more.

### Example usage
With this update, defining icons dynamically inside webforJ is simple:

```java
Img icon = new Img("icons://icon-192x192.png");
```

This tells webforJ to generate the correct icon sizes dynamically, improving efficiency while ensuring compatibility across all platforms.

## Breaking changes ðŸ› 
This release introduces a few notable changes that may require updates to your existing code:

1) `BBjWindowAdapter` and `Panel` marked as `final`
The `BBjWindowAdapter` and `Panel` classes are now final, preventing subclassing. This change improves stability and enforces consistent usage patterns.

2) `getWebforjHelper()` method is replaced with `getBridge()`
The `getWebforjHelper()` method has been deprecated and replaced with `getBridge()`. If your app relies on `getWebforjHelper()`, update your code accordingly.

:::important `getWebforjHelper()` deprecation 
The `getWebforjHelper()` method is marked for removal in a future version. Please migrate to `getBridge()` to ensure compatibility.

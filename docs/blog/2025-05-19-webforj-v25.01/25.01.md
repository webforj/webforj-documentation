webforJ 25.01 is a targeted release that introduces the `Tree` component and marks the debut of startforJ, a new tool designed to simplify project scaffolding for webforJ developers.

## New `Tree` component

The `Tree` component in webforJ has been introduced and provides a feature-rich way for developers to build hierarchical data structures. This component is designed to handle complex tree-like data models, and offers a wide range of customization options for visual presentation and user interaction.

### Node expansion and collapse
Easily manage the expanded or collapsed state of nodes to present information in a more organized manner. You can also programmatically expand or collapse nodes based on the application's logic.

### Using icons in a `Tree`

Each node in the tree can have its own icon, allowing you to visually differentiate between different node types. Here are the main icon types you can set:

- **Collapsed Node Icon** - Shown when a group node is collapsed, typically a folder icon.
- **Expanded Node Icon** - Shown when a group node is expanded, indicating its children are visible.
- **Leaf Node Icon** - Used for terminal nodes that have no children, like files in a file tree.
- **Selected Leaf Node Icon** - Used for leaf nodes that are currently selected.
- **Per-Node Icons** - Custom icons for individual nodes, providing fine-grained control over appearance.
- **Per-Node Selected Icons** - Custom icons for individual nodes when selected, enhancing visual feedback.

For example:

```java
Tree tree = new Tree();
TreeNode rootNode = Tree.node("root").setIcon("dwc:folder").setSelectedIcon("dwc:folder-open");
TreeNode fileNode = Tree.node("file.txt").setIcon("dwc:file");
tree.add(rootNode, fileNode);
```

Additionally, you have the flexibility to show or hide icons for group and leaf nodes, allowing for a more streamlined or visually distinct tree layout. For example:

```java
tree.setGroupIconsVisible(false);  // Hide icons for group nodes
tree.setLeafIconsVisible(true);    // Show icons for leaf nodes
```

### Connection Lines

For a more structured appearance, you can enable connection lines between parent and child nodes, or disable them for a cleaner, minimalist design. This allows you to control the overall visual hierarchy and readability of the tree.

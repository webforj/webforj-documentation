webforJ 25.01 is a targeted release that introduces the `Tree` component and marks the debut of startforJ, a new tool designed to simplify project scaffolding for webforJ developers.

## New `Tree` component

The `Tree` component in webforJ has been introduced and provides a feature-rich way for developers to build hierarchical data structures. This component is designed to handle complex tree-like data models, and offers a wide range of customization options for visual presentation and user interaction. 

<div 
  style={{
    display: 'flex', 
    justifyContent: 'center', 
    margin: '1rem 0', 
    width: '100%'
  }}
>
  <video width="100%" controls>
    <source src='https://cdn.webforj.com/webforj-documentation/video/release/tree.mp4' type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>

The component supports expanding and collapsing nodes for better organization. You can assign different icons to nodes to visually distinguish types and control whether connection lines between nodes are shown. This flexibility helps create clear and intuitive hierarchical views.

For more information on the `Tree` component, how to use it in an app, and the various features of the component, take a look at the [docs article](/docs/components/tree) for an in-depth look.

Below is an example of a `Tree` component:

## Introducing startforJ

[startforJ](https://docs.webforj.com/startforj/) is a powerful new tool for quickly generating webforJ apps. It provides a simple, guided interface that walks you through the process of creating a fully configured project, complete with a pre-defined structure, necessary dependencies, and starter code.

<div class="videos-container">
  <video controls>
    <source src="https://cdn.webforj.com/webforj-documentation/video/archetypes/starforj.mov" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>

With startforJ, you can select from a range of predefined [archetypes](/docs/building-ui/archetypes/overview), each designed to provide a strong starting point for different types of webforJ apps. Beyond just scaffolding, startforJ allows you to customize key project settings like group ID, artifact ID, version, and package name. It also supports customization of app themes and icons, giving you full control over your app's initial look and feel.

Once your project configuration is complete, startforJ can package your app as a downloadable ZIP file, or directly push it to a GitHub repository for easy collaboration.

Creating a new project with startforJ can be as simple as:

1. Visiting the startforJ website.
2. Selecting an appropriate archetype.
3. Customizing project settings, including name, icon, and theme.
4. Downloading the generated project as a ZIP file or pushing it to GitHub for immediate collaboration.

For more information on startforJ, see the [Getting Started](/docs/introduction/getting-started) article to read more.

As always, see the [GitHub release overview](https://github.com/webforj/webforj/releases/tag/25.01) for a more comprehensive list of changes.

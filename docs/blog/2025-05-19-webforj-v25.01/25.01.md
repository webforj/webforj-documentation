webforJ 25.01 is a targeted release that introduces the `Tree` component and marks the debut of startforJ, a new tool designed to simplify project scaffolding for webforJ developers.

## New `Tree` component

The `Tree` component in webforJ has been introduced and provides a feature-rich way for developers to build hierarchical data structures. This component is designed to handle complex tree-like data models, and offers a wide range of customization options for visual presentation and user interaction.

### Node expansion and collapse
Easily manage the expanded or collapsed state of nodes to present information in a more organized manner. You can also programmatically expand or collapse nodes based on the application's logic.

### Using icons in a `Tree`

Each node in the tree can have its own icon, allowing you to visually differentiate between leaf nodes, expanded nodes, and selected nodes. This can include folder icons for group nodes and file icons for individual items. For example:

```java
Tree tree = new Tree();
TreeNode rootNode = Tree.node("root").setIcon("dwc:folder").setSelectedIcon("dwc:folder-open");
TreeNode fileNode = Tree.node("file.txt").setIcon("dwc:file");
tree.add(rootNode, fileNode);
```

Additionally, you have the flexibility to show or hide icons for group and leaf nodes, allowing for a more streamlined or visually distinct tree layout. For example:

```java
tree.setGroupIconsVisible(false);  // Hide icons for group nodes
tree.setLeafIconsVisible(true);    // Show icons for leaf nodes
```
